		description: `The intersection of automated pattern recognition (aka artificial intelligence), renewable systems (aka sustainability) and invention (aka design) is complex, interdependent and urgent. Diving deep and flying high, we will explore it from different perspectives and try to create a map that can guide us for our upcoming explorations and (com)missions.`

		description: `Tom White (dribnet) is a New Zealand based artist investigating machine perception. His current work focuses on creating physical artworks that highlight how machines “see” and thus how they think, suggesting that these systems are capable of abstraction and conceptual thinking. He has exhibited computer based artwork internationally over the past 25 years with themes of artificial intelligence, interactivity, and computational creativity. He is currently a lecturer and researcher at University of Wellington School of Design where he teaches students the creative potential of computer programming and artificial intelligence.`

		description: `The joint project KITegg has the mission to explore how AI and ML can be integrated into design teaching. For more than a year, the 5 participating universities have now gathered concrete experience. What can the collaborators report: Which formats have worked well and which have not? How do you prioritize within a technologically complex topic? What translations and simplifications are needed? How do you promote the necessary "rigour" and a healthy critical attitude in the face of a topic that is overrepresented and often distorted in the media? Can experiences from other technologies taught in the design context, e.g. creative coding, be transferred to the teaching of AI? <br/><br/>Panelists:<br/><br/>- Andreas Refsgaard<br/>- Florian Jenett<br/>- Markus Mau</br>- Jakob Kilian`
