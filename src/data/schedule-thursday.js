		description: `In just a few months time as tools like DALL•E and ChatGPT went mainstream, safety considerations and UX best practices for using AI-generated image and text outputs went  from theoretical to urgent. I'll discuss my firsthand experience developing UX guidelines for labeling of manipulated and synthetic media, and reflect on the evolving considerations and adversarial "anti-personas" as the technology has become more accessible. I'll also discuss how designers and researchers might think about AI safety across the design process, from model training and prompt engineering to guardrails and disclosure for user-facing outputs.`
