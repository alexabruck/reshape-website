		subtitle: 'UX of AI',
		description: `Designing AI/ML-driven applications is different from designing event posters or more static mobile apps. Designing the user experience of adaptive, intelligent, and semi-autonomous systems present a range of new challenges for us designers to take on. This talk introduces you to exactly that - ranging from interactions around explainability and user feedback mechanisms, to greater ethical challenges such as echo chambers and data bias ðŸ“ˆ We also look at UX as having great potential to shape algorithmic interactions for the better and close the gap between the abstract promises of ethical AI principles and peopleâ€™s lived experience. If you're looking to deepen your understanding of design for AI and how design(ers) can shape the course of AI, this one is for you!`

		description: `Ploipailin Flynn is a business and product strategist interested in the design and build of radically equitable and antiracist futures. She got tired of well-designed tech products and services that turned "accidentally" racist, so she launched ANTI ( antiracistby.design ) as a place of reference for business and product leads to build things that are antiracist by design. Her areas of interest include: The relationship between revenue models and discriminatory design. Antiracist and decolonial futures. Translating abstract principles into tangible products and services. Researching the intersectional impacts of Big Tech, AI, capitalism. `

		description: `In just a few months time as tools like DALLâ€¢E and ChatGPT went mainstream, safety considerations and UX best practices for using AI-generated image and text outputs went  from theoretical to urgent. I'll discuss my firsthand experience developing UX guidelines for labeling of manipulated and synthetic media, and reflect on the evolving considerations and adversarial "anti-personas" as the technology has become more accessible. I'll also discuss how designers and researchers might think about AI safety across the design process, from model training and prompt engineering to guardrails and disclosure for user-facing outputs.`
