She got tired of well-designed tech products and services that turned "accidentally" racist, so she launched ANTI (<a href="http://antiracistby.design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline">antiracistby.design</a> ) as a place of reference for business and product leads to build things that are antiracist by design. Her areas of interest include: The relationship between revenue models and discriminatory design. Antiracist and decolonial futures. Translating abstract principles into tangible products and services. Researching the intersectional impacts of Big Tech, AI, capitalism. `,

His current work focuses on creating physical artworks that highlight how machines “see” and thus how they think, suggesting that these systems are capable of abstraction and conceptual thinking. He has exhibited computer based artwork internationally over the past 25 years with themes of artificial intelligence, interactivity, and computational creativity. He is currently a lecturer and researcher at University of Wellington School of Design where he teaches students the creative potential of computer programming and artificial intelligence.`,
